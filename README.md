🎰 JavaScript Slot Machine
Welcome to my Slot Machine Game, built entirely with vanilla JavaScript! This is a fun and interactive console-based game where you can:

💰 Deposit virtual money

🎯 Bet on 1–3 lines

🌀 Spin the reels

🏆 Win based on matching symbols

The goal was to simulate a basic slot machine mechanic using core JavaScript concepts like arrays, loops, randomization, and simple game logic — no libraries or frameworks involved!
